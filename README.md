# ShadowFox
This repository contains my data science projects from the ShadowFox Data Science Internship. The projects focus on data visualization, air quality analysis, and music dataset exploration. Each project applies data science techniques to extract insights from real-world datasets.

**Technologies Used:**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn,Dash(for interactive visualizations).
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

**Project:**
1)**Beginner Level: Data Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn:**
-Created various plots (line charts, scatter plots, histograms, etc.).
-Learned how to customize plots and add labels.
-Practical use of visualization for data storytelling.

2)**Intermediate Level: Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis**
-Cleaned and preprocessed AQI dataset.
-Time-series analysis to observe pollution trends.
-Visualized AQI variations over time.

3) **Advanced Level: Music Dataset Analysis**
-Data preprocessing and encoding handling for a Spotify dataset.
-Visualized music trends using interactive graphs.
-Explored relationships between audio features and popularity.

**KEY LEARNINGS:**
-Hands-on experience with data visualization.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with real-world datasets.
-Working with time-series and interactive dashboards.
